## Installation

After the [initial setup](https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted),
you can try this command to install our custom reporter: `npm install wdio-graspit-reporter`. It would take some time.

Reference: [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wdio-graspit-reporter)

## Configuration

```js filename="wdio.conf.js"
const config = {
	specs: "...",
	framework: "...",
	// ....
};

attachReporter(config, {
	projectName: "app-automation",
	port: 6969,
	collectionName: "TestResults",
	root: process.cwd(),
	timeout: 120e3,
	export: {
		out: "./dist",
		maxTestRuns: 3,
	},
});
```

you would notice we haven't mentioned our reporter in the `reporters` or `services` array.
Since We are using both [Custom Reporter]() and [Launcher](), it would be eaiser to let the helper function add required things in the configuration.
you could use this `attachReporter` helper function for that.

You can know more about the configuration options from [here](../Advanced/configuration).

## Execution

After letting the custom reporter is assigned, we could execute the tests. Make sure to add certain scripts inside your `package.json`.

-   `activate`: `"venv\Scripts\activate"` in windows else `source "venv/bin/activate"`
-   `display`: `npm run activate && graspit display ./dist`

### activate

This custom script would activate the venv added, make sure to add the required script based on your OS.

### display

we would first activate the venv and then use our graspit cli to display the reports generated in `dist` folder (or wherever required). This would spun a server that would host the static files generated from Next.js export.
