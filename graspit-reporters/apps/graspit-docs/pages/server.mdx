## Getting Started:

In this step, we would be setting up python venv in our project, if you have python **3.11** installed, you can skip the jump to second step.
This particular step is required regardless of the test framework used.

-   Install [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)

-   Move to the root directory, and execute this command `python -m venv venv`

    <Alert
    	type="info"
    	message="We would be creating a virtual environment, under the name venv. We would see venv folder in your root directory after this."
    />

-   After the venv creation, create a file `requirements.txt`

    ```text filename="requirements.txt"
    graspit>=0.8.1
    ```

    <Alert
    	type="info"
    	message="graspit version mentioned may not be updated ones, please refer to the post installation steps for updating the package."
    />

-   Activate the venv, If in **windows**, `venv\Scripts\activate`, else On **Unix or MacOS**, run: `source venv/bin/activate`

-   Now Install packages through: `pip install -r requiremnts.txt`

-   `graspit --help`
    you would see the below text (may not be exact) as the output.

    ```cmd
    Usage: graspit [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
    Options:
    --help Show this message and exit.
    Commands:
    display
    export
    patch
    run-app
    ```

## Past Setup

Now that we have setup graspit package on python,
Please download [PyPI Assistant](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twixes.pypi-assistant), a VSCode Extension, or similar one in your IDE. so we can update to the latest version.

That's all for this step.
