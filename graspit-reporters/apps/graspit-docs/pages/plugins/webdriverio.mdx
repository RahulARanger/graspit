## Installation

Make sure you have done the [required setup](https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted) for webdriverio past
you can try this command, to install our custom reporter: `npm install wdio-graspit-reporter`

It would take some time.

[NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wdio-graspit-reporter)

## Configuration

You can refer to the general configuration options from [here]().

Here's the general one, you would notice we haven't mentioned it in the `reporters` or `services`,
it is because we have both [Custom Reporter]() and [Launcher]() and both are dependent and hence to make it simple
we use helper function which would the append the required values.

```js filename="wdio.conf.js"
const config = {
	specs: "...",
	framework: "...",
	// ....
};

attachReporter(config, {
	projectName: "app-automation",
	port: 6969,
	collectionName: "TestResults",
	root: process.cwd(),
	timeout: 120e3,
	export: {
		out: "./dist",
		maxTestRuns: 3,
	},
});
```
