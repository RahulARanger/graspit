## Introduction

Here we would be exploring the architecture of our [turbo](https://turbo.build/) repo, we have for nodejs based reporters and dashboard.

## Packages

-   graspit - Next.js project for our dashboard
-   graspit-commons - Helper package to store most of our common constants and functions in order to interact with graspit server.
-   graspit-reporters - Custom Reporter for various test frameworks.

## Dependancy

| Bump if ↓, Release → | graspit | graspit-commons | reporters |
| -------------------- | ------- | --------------- | --------- |
| graspit              | ✅      | ❌              | ❌        |
| graspit-commons      | ❌      | ✅              | ❌        |
| reporters            | ❌      | ✅              | ✅        |

Above table summarizes our [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/config-file-options.md) configuration. if we have some changes on `graspit-commons`.
we would bump the version of ant reporters `*-graspit-reporter` so we would have release for all the reporters along with `graspit-commons` in that case.
