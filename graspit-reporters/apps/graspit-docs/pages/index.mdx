# Welcome to Graspit

**Graspit** offers a service for saving your test results and creating a dashboard.
This dashboard is generated using Next.js and Ant Design (antd),
while our Python server, spun by Sanic, handles the storage and management of your test data.
Your test results are stored in an SQLite3 database, and the dashboard is a static export of our Next.js project.

## Quick Start

For Getting Started with the setup, we could shorten it with three steps, please go through them one by one.
