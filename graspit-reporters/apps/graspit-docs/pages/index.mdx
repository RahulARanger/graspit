# Welcome to Graspit

**Graspit** offers a service for saving your test results and creating a dashboard.
This dashboard is generated using Next.js and Ant Design (antd),
while our Python server, spun by Sanic, handles the storage and management of your test data.
Your test results are stored in an SQLite3 database, and the dashboard is a static export of our Next.js project.

## Quick Start

For Getting Started with the setup, we could shorten it with three steps, please go through them one by one.

## Motivation

In my professional experience, I've used pytest and webdriverio.
I've written tests that ran for 2-3 hours on an EC2 instance.
However, monitoring these tests through logs was challenging,
and connecting to AWS CLI was time-consuming.

Therefore, I decided to create a versatile reporting tool.
This tool can generate dynamic reports while our test framework is running,
making the whole process much more transparent.
