# Welcome to Graspit

**Graspit** offers a service for saving your test results and creating a dashboard.
This dashboard is generated using Next.js and Ant Design (antd),
while our Python server, spun by Sanic, handles the storage and management of your test data.
Your test results are stored in an SQLite3 database, and the dashboard is a static export of our Next.js project.

## Quick Start

For Getting Started with the setup, we could shorten it with three steps, please go through them one by one.

## Motivation

I have worked with `pytest` and `webdriverio` in workplace. and I had written tests which would run
for 2-3 hrs in ec2 instance, so if we had to peek at the logs to check whether it's running or not or to check where it is at. it was a bit hassle as we can't
guess where it is at through logs, and connecting with aws cli is bit time-consuming.

Hence I have decided to work on a reporter that would be generic and has a capability of creating dynamic reports while our test framework is running.
