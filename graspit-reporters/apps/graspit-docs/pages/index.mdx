# Welcome to Graspit

**Graspit** makes it easy for you by saving your test results and creating a user-friendly dashboard.

## Motivation

In my org., I've used webdriverio.
I've written tests that ran for 2-3 hours on an EC2 instance.
However, monitoring these tests through logs was challenging,

Graspit generates dynamic reports while our test framework is running,
making the whole process much more transparent. Hopefully, Graspit would solve this issue.

So this reporter is made sure it doesn't need to depend on the framework used, **completely**.

## Roles

This dashboard is generated using Next.js and Ant Design (antd),
while our Python server, spun by Sanic, handles the storage and management of your test data.
Your test results are stored in an SQLite3 database, and the dashboard is a static export of our Next.js project.

## Highlights

-   Generates HTML Reports of your Test Results
-   Serves Dynamic Reports while your tests are running
-   Saves your results in database _[locally]_
