# Welcome to Graspit

**Graspit** is a service that lets you store your test results and generate a dashboard for your results.
Dashboard is generated by nextjs & antd, plus we would use sanic to host our python server which would save and manage your test results.

Test results would be stored in sqlite3 Database and the dashboard is a static export of our Next.js Project.

## Quick Start

For Getting Started with the setup, we could shorten it with three steps, please go through them one by one.
